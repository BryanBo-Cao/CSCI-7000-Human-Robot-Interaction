The first reading contains a survey of HRI by Michael Goodrich and Alan Schultz. For your comments, respond to the questions listed below the reading. Post your response in this forum.

Goodrich & Schultz: Human-Robot Interaction: A Survey (2007)

Goodrich states: "In essence, a designer can affect five attributes that affect the interactions between humans and robots." Do you agree with this list of attributes? Is it complete?
Table 5.1 presents several examples of roles and proximity patterns that arise in several application areas. Which do you find most interesting? Why?
Section 7 describes the relationship of HRI to many closely related fields. Can HRI really be considered a distinct discipline, or should it be considered a sub-field of another area of study (e.g., robotics, hci, etc.)? Why or why not?
Anything else you found interesting about the article or didn't understand?
